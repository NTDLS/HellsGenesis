# Nebula Siege
As a Hell Fighter tribute, Nebula Siege is a 2D space fighter game engine written in C# (currently .net7) and DirectX.

Infinite space, neural network AI, multiple scenario, event driven, locking/seeking weapons, etc.

For the first first 3 years, this was rendering with GDI+ which was for the challenge but I caved and moved to DirectX. I was still getting about 80FPS, but the locking required to do basic thigs like "measure strings" with a decive context was causing all kinds of odd race conditions. So anyway, if you are here to see the GDI+, the last non-DirectX commit was https://github.com/NTDLS/HellsGenesis/tree/6f593ea1daf21054382b54e98f9d41ab3303ba8a.
