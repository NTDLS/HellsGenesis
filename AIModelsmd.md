When in Taunt mode, the enemy will still fire on the payer when in range.

### HostileEngagement
**Complete? []**
> Enemy will travel far if needed to get behind the player. When the player is traveling away from the
enemy, the enemy will transition into attack mode. The enemy will then travel quickly towards the player
then match speed while close behind the player, firing at all times when within range. If the player starts
to point at the enemy the enemy will transition into depart mode to get to a safe distance. The travel
speed should not be excessive when fleeing so that the player has a chance to attack.

### Meander
