# To-Do List

- [] Make _gameEngine.Menus.Collection private like EngineSpriteManager._collection.

- [] Finish AI for first peon enemy: Phoenix
	- [] Perfect the Taunt enamy AI before moving on to next AI model.
- [] Map up and down arrows to throttle max adjust.
- [x] Keep player in the middle, always centered. Allows for more visibility.
- [] If enemy sees player 45-degree in front, follow and attack.
- [] If enemy sees 45-degree behind, should do minor evasive turns. Nothing too wild - give player a chance.
- [] Current "evasive loop" logic should be reserved for enemy low-health condition.
- [] Enemies retreat when low on health, limp away and dissapear - no score for player.
- [] Make guided missiles lose their target if they turn too hard.
- [] Enemies should use more guided weapons on player.
- [] Enemies should sometimes follow eatch other if they find themselves behind another.
